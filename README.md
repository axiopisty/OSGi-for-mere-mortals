# OSGi for mere mortals

This is the code of my "OSGi for mere mortals" presentation at
ApacheCon NA 2011, http://na11.apachecon.com/talks/19416

Still a work in progress...the code compiles and you can start
it by running 

  java -jar target/osgi-for-mere-mortals-launcher-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

From the "launcher" subfolder.

I'll explain later how to demo this mini server application.
