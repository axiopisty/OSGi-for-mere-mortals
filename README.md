# OSGi for mere mortals

This is the code of my "OSGi for mere mortals" presentation at
ApacheCon NA 2011, http://na11.apachecon.com/talks/19416

Build by running `mvn clean install` at the top of the source
code tree (using <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Apache Maven</a>
3.0.3 or later), and start it from the *launcher* subfolder by running

    java -jar target/osgi-for-mere-mortals-launcher-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

(or whatever the name of that jar file is).

The slides at http://www.slideshare.net/bdelacretaz/osgi-for-mere-mortals 
should help you walk through the code.
